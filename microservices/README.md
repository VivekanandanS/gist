## Microservices Architecture 

Microservices architecture is all about creating small, distributed, single-purpose services, owning to its data; which all together function as bits and pieces representing as a single entity. 

Service and data present the notion of bounded context and a shared-nothing architecture where each service is compartmentalized and completely independent from all other services. 

Services expose well-defined contracts so that other services can interact with them.   

Independent and bounded context allows services to design, develop, test, deploy and scale with minimal effort.
